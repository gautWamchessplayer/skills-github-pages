<p>1) Soil is a living system. It has six different layers called horizons.</p>

<p>2) Interestingly since the soil is a living system it can therefore die.</p>

<p>3) Soil holds potential medical function and possible cures.</p>

<p>4) Soil microorganisms are capable of breaking down and denaturing certain toxic compounds and contaminants resulting from many human activities.</p> 

<p>5) All soils, whether polluted or unpolluted, naturally have a variety of contaminated components.</p>

<p>6) Levels of contaminant vary depending on soil depth.</p>

<p>7) Soil pollution happens when the naturally present contaminated components merge with the components that get into it from the atmosphere, thereby exceeding the natural level of soil contaminant.</p>

<p>8) Littering on soil and land has affected birds and animals to such an extent that 80% of the dead birds and animals have some form of plastic wastes in their stomachs.</p> 

<p>9) We all know that soil pollution is caused by two causes â€“ natural and man-made pollutants but did you know that the man-made causes of soil pollution are termed anthropogenic causes.</p>

<p>10) Anthropogenic activities represent the main sources of point-source soil pollution.</p>

<p>11) The chemicals used in or produced as by-products of industrial activities, domestic wastes, and petroleum-derived products are some main anthropogenic sources of soil pollution.</p>

<p>12) One of the major incidents of soil pollution caused by natural pollutants is the accumulation of higher levels of perchlorate in soil from the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
