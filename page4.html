      <li>Pick up litter and dispose of it properly.</li> 
     <ul>
       <li>One of the best ways to reduce water pollution is to prevent it at the source: by disposing of waste properly.</li>
       <li>In fact, 60% of water pollution today can be attributed to litter</li>

<ul>
  <li>Don't pour fat and grease down the drain.</li>
  <li>Most of the dishes we cook leave some sort of fat, oil, or grease residue behind. </li>
  <li>These substances should never be disposed of down the drain in your kitchen.</li>
  <li>When poured down the drain, fat and grease can build up over time and clog your pipes. </li>
  <li>This will lead to sewer pipes clogging and even backing up into your yard and basement. </li>
  <li>It can also lead to water pollution by carrying contaminants to local bodies of water.</li>
  <li>Instead, grease, fat, and used cooking oil should be disposed of in the trash or kept in a glass jar for disposal with other solid waste.</li>
</ul>
  <li>Use the minimum amount of laundry detergent</li>
<ul>
  <li>Laundry detergent and other cleaning products contain chemicals like phosphates that are harmful to our waters and marine life.</li>
  <li>Phosphates lead to algae blooms and kill fish and other aquatic animals by reducing the oxygen in the water.</li>
  <li>Soaps and detergents can also break up oil and send it lower into the water column, causing damage to more marine organisms.</li>
  <li>When spilled in our waterways, soaps and detergents in and of themselves are actually a pollutant that may be harmful.</li>
  <li>By cutting down on detergent, or using phosphate-free detergent, you can further cut down on water pollution from your own home.</li>
  <li>There are plenty of effective natural laundry detergents that you can substitute for chemically-intensive detergents in your home.</li>
</ul>
  <li>Dispose of medical waste properly</li>
<ul>
  <li>Never flush pills, powders, or liquid medicines down the toilet or dump them outside, whether on land or water.</li>
  <li>These drugs can accumulate in the water and be consumed by fish and other wildlife hormones and other compounds end up causing a variety of health problems in fish and birds and contaminate drinking water that people and livestock use.</li>
    <li>Studies have found that medicines flushed down the drain can contaminate our lakes and streams and eventually end up in our drinking water.</li>
  <li>This can lead to adverse reactions for some people and even cases of accidental poisoning.</li>  
  <li>University of Minnesota researchers have also detected antibiotics used for human and animal treatment at low levels in lakes, rivers, and streams throughout Minnesota.</li>
  <li>The U.S. Geological Survey has also found antibiotics in groundwater in both non-agricultural and urban areas.</li>
